# Nick Boswell's Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here I showcase my skills in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Software Development and Data Analysis, demonstrating my passion for solving problems through efficient automation and data-driven insights.

## About Me

I am a lead software developer transitioning into a career in data science. I am also an automation enthusiast with a background in UiPath Power Automate, and Slack Apps.\
**Skills:** Python, R, SQL, UiPath, Power Automate, Excel, Tableau/Power BI, Dynamics 365, C#, Javascript/Typescript.\
**Currently seeking:** Opportunities to contribute my automation and data analysis expertise for companies that develop innovative products to improve athlete performance - shoes, nutrition, gear, technical wear, etc.

## How to Navigate My Portfolio

Each project has its own repository with a detailed README explaining goals, methods, results, and code examples.
Project READMEs follow consistent formatting for easy scanning.
