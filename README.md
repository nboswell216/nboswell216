- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Boswell (@nboswell216)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all types of full stack development languages and processes so that I can advance my career and also promote my own brand - Optimistic Prominence (https://github.com/orgs/Optimistic-Prominence). After successfully promoting my brand, I have an exciting app idea that I am looking forward to bringing to fruition.
- 📫 Look on the Optimistic Prominence contact page on how to contact me!
- 🏢 I currently work for Cognizant as a Senior Software Engineer in the React space, for our NCR client. My previous role at the company was working on RPA with UiPath for clients such as PwC and Pandora.
